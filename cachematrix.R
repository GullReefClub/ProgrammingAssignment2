## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

# The functionality submitted is closely tied to the template code given in the 
# assignment. To achieve working code only the function calls needed changing
# (i.e., replacing "mean" with "solve".)  Describing what happens is more 
# interesting.
 
# The first function, makeCacheMatrix, is used to instantiate an object in R 
# which is similar to a 'class' in modern OOP languages. It contains 4 
# behaviors which are analogous to 'methods' of a 'class' under the OOP paradigm.
# One of these stores the input parameter

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
